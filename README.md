# Alien-Invasion
A game I modified using the Python Crash course book
With the help of the Python Crash Handbook, I was able to create an alien invasion game using pygame. 
I modified the code by refactoring and being able to save the highscore.
To move alien use the left and right key (up and down key I modified)
To shoot press the spacebar. 

If you want to save your score, you will need to press the 'Q' button so that the highscore is read into a file. 
Once you restart the game the high will be available until it is beaten. 

The next challenge I will be doing is for the aliens to shoot downwards. Any suggestions please share.
